# Verifiable Credential Authentication with OpenID Connect (VC-AuthN OIDC)

This repository is the home of a project to achieve verifiable credential based authentication using OpenID Connect.

See [here](/docs/README.md) for background into how this integration is defined.

## Debug

The VCAuthn-Service has two main dependencies

1. A backend database, postgres is used as the provider
2. An instance of [ACA-Py](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python) for handling the interactions with verifiable credentials

To run the OIDC-Controller in debug, first you must run these dependencies with the following command

```
    docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.local-debug.yml
```

Following this you can either launch the VCAuthn-Service in debug via an IDE like VS Code or Visual Studio or run the following command

```
    dotnet run ./src/VCAuthn
```

## A Quick Demo

The following demo starts up the VCAuthn-Service and its associated dependencies, along with an instance of keycloak.

To start the demo run the following commands from within the `docker` folder:

```
    ./manage build
    ./manage start
```

Once you have the service running, a presentation request configuration must be configured on the service. You can configure this through either browsing to the swagger interface [here](http://localhost:5000) or running the following curl command with a valid request body

```
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/vc-configs" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Test" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"id\" : \"test-request-config\", \"subject_identifier\" : \"attribute1\", \"configuration\" : { \"name\" : \"test\", \"version\" : 1.0, \"requested_attributes\" : { \"attribute1\": { \"name\" : \"attribute1\", \"restrictions\" : [ { \"schema_id\": \"123\", \"schema_issuer_did\": \"\", \"schema_name\": \"name\", \"schema_version\": \"\", \"issuer_did\": \"\", \"cred_def_id\": \"\" }\t\t\t\t] }, \"attribute2\": { \"name\" : \"attribute2\", \"restrictions\" : [ { \"schema_id\": \"345\", \"schema_issuer_did\": \"\", \"schema_name\": \"name\", \"schema_version\": \"\", \"issuer_did\": \"\", \"cred_def_id\": \"\" }\t\t\t\t] }\t\t} }}"
```

> The API is protected with an APIKey which defaults to `Test` in the demo

An example of a valid presentation request configuration is the following.

```
{
    "id" : "test-request-config",
    "subject_identifier" : "attribute1",
    "configuration" : {
        "name" : "test",
        "version" : 1.0,
        "requested_attributes" : {
            "attribute1": {
                "name" : "attribute1",
                "restrictions" : [
                    {
                        "schema_id": "123",
                        "schema_issuer_did": "",
                        "schema_name": "name",
                        "schema_version": "",
                        "issuer_did": "",
                        "cred_def_id": ""
                    }
				]
            },
            "attribute2": {
                "name" : "attribute2",
                "restrictions" : [
                    {
                        "schema_id": "345",
                        "schema_issuer_did": "",
                        "schema_name": "name",
                        "schema_version": "",
                        "issuer_did": "",
                        "cred_def_id": ""
                    }
				]
            }
		}
    }
}
```

After configuring this, if you used the above presentation request configuration example, you can browse to keycloaks login page with this [link](http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/vc-authn/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=security-admin-console&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8180%2Fauth%2Fadmin%2Fmaster%2Fconsole%2F%23%2Frealms%2Fvc-authn%2Fidentity-provider-settings&state=f0bfe2a2-a9b3-42dc-a84b-cb50e88055eb&response_mode=fragment&response_type=code&scope=openid&nonce=c93d4634-e6fc-45d8-8a4c-bc9a28db56dc&pres_req_conf_id=test-request-config)

From here you can click the `vc-authn` option to try out the flow. Clicking this should redirect your browser to the VC-Authn service and display a QR-Code base challenge.
